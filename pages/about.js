      <p>
        My name is Julio Pinheiro and I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. <br />
        {"I've"} been a software developer for the last nine years! and worked
        in different business areas and with very cool and interesting
        technologies. I have learned a lot during my career and what I value the
        most is meeting the real needs of the customers/business. I also had the
        great opportunity to lead teams during some projects and understand the
        profiles of each of them. I really enjoy teaching, especially to people
        new to the field, I have had several nice opportunities in this regard.
        I also like to learn from the team and keep the team engaged.
