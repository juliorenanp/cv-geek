        Hi, my name is Julio Pinheiro and I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. {"I've"}  been
        a software developer for the past nine years! and working in several
        business segments and with very cool and interesting technologies. I
        learned a lot during my career, and what I value the most is
        delivering the real needs of the clients/business. I also had the
        great opportunity to lead teams during some projects, understanding the
        profiles of each one. I really enjoy teaching, especially to people new
        to the area, I had several nice opportunities in this regard. I also
        like to learn from the team and keep the team engaged.
